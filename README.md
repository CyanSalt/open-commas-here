## Open Commas Here

### What is Commas

[Commas](https://github.com/CyanSalt/commas) is a hackable terminal and command runner.

### How to use

**Notice: to follow the steps below, you might need an apple developer account (free).**

* You can open the `Open Commas Here.applescript` file in your Script Editor (could be found by Launchpad or Spotlight). If you have installed Commas outside the application folder, the file path in script source code should be replaced first.

* Click "File > Export as..." to export the script as "application" instead of "script". You must select your code signature to avoid infinite asking for permissions in the next step. Code signature could be generated in your XCode preference.

* Then you can just drag the exported application to Finder's toolbar with <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> pressed. Click the icon to open current directory in a new tab of Commas.
